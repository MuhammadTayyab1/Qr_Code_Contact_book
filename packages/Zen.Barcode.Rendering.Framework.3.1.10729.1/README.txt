The bar-code rendering framework quite simply encapsulates the native rendering of barcode symbologies without requiring third-party fonts.

The framework makes it easy to define new symbologies and use the resultant images from web or forms applications in a variety of usage scenarios.

Currently supported bar-code symbologies;

Code 11 with or without checksum
Code 25 standard/interleaved with or without checksum
Code 39 with or without checksum
Code 93 with checksum only
Code 128 with checksum only
Code EAN 13 with checksum only
Code EAN 8 with checksum only
Code PDF417 2D (still alpha – still broken)
